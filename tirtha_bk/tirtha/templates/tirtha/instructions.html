            <p>
                Before you begin, please read the following instructions:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li><em>Ensure you have a Google account for authentication.</em></li>
                <li>Click "Contribute" to open the upload form.</li>
                <li>Read the <a href="/project/tirtha/#terms">Terms of Use</a> and <a href="/project/tirtha/#privacy">Privacy Policy</a> and click on the
                    checkbox, if you agree.</li>
                <li>Authenticate by clicking "Sign in with Google". <em>Only your email address and profile name will be accessed.</em></li>
                <li>After authentication, the upload form will be enabled. Select the heritage site and upload images. The list of available sites is on the right. "Open" means contributions are being accepted, "Closed" means they are not.</li>
                <li><em>Upload up to 2000 images (total size of &lt; 1 GB)</em> that meet these requirements for the internal photogrammetry pipeline:
                    <ul class="ul-inner">
                        <li>The object of interest (a part of the building) is clearly visible, without obstructions (people, vegetation, etc.), and in focus.</li>
                        <li>Images are taken from multiple angles or viewpoints with <strong>30 - 40% overlap between images</strong>.</li>
                        <li>Lighting conditions are consistent with no dark shadows, reflections, or transparent objects. Prefer diffused lighting.</li>
                        <li>Images have minimal blur, noise, distortion, or pixelation.</li>
                        <li>Use either landscape or portrait orientation (do not mix both) to avoid distortion.</li>
                        <li>Images must be above <strong>1080p</strong> in resolution and <strong>contain EXIF data</strong>, mainly the camera parameters.</li>
                        <li>In general, try to upload images for a low-resolution or missing part of the building in the live model.</li>
                        <li><strong>Try to be as safe as possible while taking images. Do not trespass or put yourself in danger.</strong></li>
                    </ul>
                    <em>Images not meeting these requirements will be filtered out (as they may not contribute to the model).</em>
                    Confirm that you are not uploading images that<sup>[Check <a href="/project/tirtha/#terms">ToS</a> & <a href="/project/tirtha/#privacy">Privacy Policy</a>]</sup>:

                        <li>contain sensitive information or personal data.</li>
                        <li>are not yours or you don't have the right to upload.</li>
                        <li>are unrelated to the site you're uploading to.</li>

                </li>
                <li>On desktop, you can drag and drop multiple images at once to the upload area. On mobile, you can select multiple images from your gallery.</li>
                <li>Upon successful upload, a confirmation message will appear, and the form will reset. You can close the form or upload more images.</li>
                <li><strong>Note:</strong> <em>It may take a few days to process the images and update the models.</em></li>
