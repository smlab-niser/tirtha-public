            We use Google OAuth2 for authentication of contributors, i.e., "people who upload images". This is done via <a href="https://docs.authlib.org/en/latest/client/django.html" target+"_blank">Authlib's Django OAuth Client</a> and no tracking cookies are used. Only your email address and public profile name ("personal information") are stored to identify your contributions, i.e., "sets of images uploaded by you", on this website.
        </li>
        <li>
            Uploaded images are stored on our servers, and the associated metadata, including EXIF data and GPS coordinates (if available), is used solely for 3D model reconstruction purposes.
        </li>
        <li>
            All pre-processing steps, except NSFW filtering, occur client-side on your browser or server-side on our end. We utilize local models and the <a href="https://cloud.google.com/vision/docs/detecting-safe-search" target="_blank">Google CloudVision API</a> for NSFW image filtering. The images are uploaded to Google servers for filtering purposes but are not stored on them.
        </li>
        <li>
            Your personal information and uploaded images are not sold or rented to any third party.

            Your personal information is retained as long as you have at least one contribution associated with your account.
